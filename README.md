# AustrianEconomicsForum
End-of-course project in which a social network/forum will be implemented, with the main theme revolving around economics, politics, and other social sciences from an Austrian School of Economics perspective. It will be implemented using native CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, with a MySQL database and PHP for the interaction with the database. 

Note: The fork of this project won't work without the private key for the Google Storage API
